# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Purpose
To prepare for upcoming staff retirements, Pewlett Hackard has tasked its Human Resources Department with compiling a list of soon-to be retirees at the company. Additionally, a list of staff who are 10 years from retirement age was compiled as candidates for a mentorship program. Mentorship candidates will work with soon-to-be retirees to better prepare those staff individually, and the company overall, for when the retirees leave. 
### Data
Four tables and CSV files were created to fulfill this brief and are described more in the Results and Summary sections below.

## Results
Overall, the data on the tables yielded information for all employee numbers of staff who were born between 1952 and 1955.
### Data
- 90398 names with unique employee ID numbers were returned in the query for staff who may be eligible for retirement
- Senior Engineers had the highest count by employee title at 29414 of the 90398 employees found in the table
