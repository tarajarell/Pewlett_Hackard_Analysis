# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Purpose
To prepare for upcoming staff retirements, Pewlett Hackard has tasked its Human Resources Department with compiling a list of soon-to be retirees at the company. Additionally, a list of staff who are 10 years from retirement age was compiled as candidates for a mentorship program. Mentorship candidates will work with soon-to-be retirees to better prepare those staff individually, and the company overall, for when the retirees leave. 
### Data
Four tables and CSV files were created to fulfill this brief and are described more in the Results and Summary sections below.

## Results
Overall, the data on the tables yielded information for all employee numbers of staff who were born between 1952 and 1955.
### Data
- 90,398 names with unique employee ID numbers were returned in the query for staff who may be eligible for retirement
- Senior Engineers had the highest count by employee title at 29,414 of the 90,398 employees found in the table
- 1,549 current employees are eligible under the birth date criteria to participate in the mentorship program
- 88,849 retiring employees would not have mentor matches

## Summary
### Overview 

### Answers
### Recommendations
Additional queries could be run to create tables which include more specific information to help support Pewlett Hackard prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami."
1. The data for retirees included past emoployees as well as current employees. The numbers of current employees who are eligible for retirement may be less than what we found in the abovementioned queries, resulting in less mentors needed to match to retirees.
2. If the numbers for retiring employees are still not close to the numbers for mentors after all past employees are removed from them, it may behoove the HR team to run another query related to the mentorship eligibility. Specifically, increasing the mentorship eligibility information to include multiple birth years rather than one may enlarge the pool of employees to match with a soon-to-be retired emaployee.



Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
